# Neighborhood Map Project
## Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree (Project #5)

### Overview
This project uses JavaScript, jQuery, knockoutJS, Google Maps API, and the Yelp API to create a map of the breweries I have visited in Denver, CO.

#### License

All code is provided under the MIT license.

### Using the app

You can view the site by opening index.html through a browser.

#### Using the list & search feature

Users can filter the list of locations based on location name. When searching, you can either click the 'search' button or hit enter and both the brewery list and the markers will be filtered according to the search criteria.

#### Linking New York Times API

NY Times api is used to provide news article for each location name. The content will be displayed in infowindow of the marker with a link to the new article site
