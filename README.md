# Neighborhood Map Project
## Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree (Project #5)

### Overview

### Using the app

You can view the site by opening index.html through a browser.

#### Using the list & search feature

Users can filter the list of locations based on location name. When searching, you can either click the 'search' button or hit enter and both the brewery list and the markers will be filtered according to the search criteria.
